# Be My Valentine? ‚ù§Ô∏è

This repository contains the source code for a fun "Be My Valentine?" website with a playful twist.  It features a "Yes" and "No" button, where saying "No" makes the "Yes" button progressively larger, adding a humorous element to the proposal.  Saying "Yes" redirects the user to a special page.

This project was created for someone very special in my life. üòä
I might add some music in the background, sometime soon.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS

## Features

* **Interactive Buttons:** Clicking "Yes" or "No" triggers different actions.
* **Growing "Yes" Button:** Every time "No" is clicked, the "Yes" button increases in size, making it harder to avoid. üòâ
* **Special "Yes" Page:** Clicking "Yes" redirects the user to a dedicated `yes.html` page.  This page can be personalized with a special message, image, or even a video.
* **Background Image:** A background image enhances the romantic atmosphere.  Choose an image that resonates with the recipient.
